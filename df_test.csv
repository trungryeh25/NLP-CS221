1,"Do you remember when you were a kid and you saw that Zinedine Zidane had moved to Real Madrid for £45m? It seemed like so much money at the time - but it's fairly standard these days for chairmen of big clubs across Europe to PayPal each other figures that large for players. £45m these days buys you the right leg of some players. Tens of millions of pounds is still a lot of money in the real world - and yet we baulk at the idea of receiving £20m for a player worth 30, £50m for a player worth 100.",Football,100,483,3,20
2,"Footage from Barcelona's new Amazon Prime series has revealed the reaction from team-mates after they discovered Lionel Messi was leaving the club in 2021. Last summer, the Argentina forward was forced to walk away from the Camp Nou after his contract came to an end and he was unable to renew due to economic and structural obstacles. It was a stunning moment as the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner left the club to join PSG, and Barcelona's new series shows the shocked reaction from team-mates after they found out the news.",Football,96,,3,
3,"Haaland had missed two good chances in the first half, and City had needed Rodri to fire them ahead against Jesse Marsch’s side in stoppage time at the end of the opening 45 minutes. City then doubled their lead five minutes after the restart. A quick break saw Jack Grealish square the ball to Haaland to prod the ball into an empty net. The two combined again just after the hour to make it 3-0 and seal the three points. Pascal Struijk did pull one back for Leeds but it was just a consolation as the night belonged to Haaland.",Football,101,,5,
4,"The 34-year-old, who came through the academy at the club, returned to Anfield in the summer in a player-coach role. Along with being a coach for the Under-18s, the 2012 League Cup winner was registered as an over-age player for the Under-21 side. He was even a replacement for Brazilian star Arthur earlier in the season during a Papa John’s Trophy clash against Rochdale. But in a shock for Spearing, he has declared how he has been diagnosed with a rare disorder of the adrenal glands.",Football,92,,4,
5,"The Brazilian sulked his way off the pitch, kicking a loose ball in frustration after seeing two yellow cards within 90 seconds. It was a sobering end to an electric 62 minutes from Neymar. All neat flicks and darting dribbles, he had controlled the match before throwing the result into jeopardy by picking up an unnecessary second booking for a dive in the Strasbourg penalty area. It was a moment not out of character for the oft-criticized forward. Neymar has long been maligned for his short temper and penchant for going to ground.",Football,94,,5,
6,"Andy Murray and his brother Jamie beat Neal Skupski and Dan Evans in straight sets in Aberdeen but Scotland fall to 8-4 defeat against England; Andy Murray will head to the Australian Open encouraged by his performances. Andy and Jamie Murray were victorious in possibly their final match together in Scotland but England walked away with the inaugural Schroders Battle of the Brits trophy. Organised by Jamie Murray, the Scotland versus England clash proved a hit in Aberdeen, with around 20,000 fans attending the P&J Live arena across two days.",Tennis,93,557,4,18
7,"The 6ft 1in right-handed Austrian has always had the game to do well on the surface with a booming backhand, stamina, graceful movement and aggressive play from the baseline. To prove a point, he conquered Nadal in the Barcelona Open semi-finals to become the first player other than Novak Djokovic to defeat the Spaniard on clay four times before capping an impressive week by crushing Daniil Medvedev 6-4 6-0 to win the title. He takes on 33-year-old Nadal in a repeat of last year's Roland Garros final but the Austrian will be feeling far more confident he can give the Spaniard a run for his money after ending Novak Djokovic's 26-match winning streak at Grand Slams. He is Austria's biggest tennis star since Thomas Muster, and now the 25-year-old is playing a free-flowing game under the tutelage of Olympic gold medallist Nicolas Massu.",Tennis,156,,4,
8,"Nick Kyrgios’ late withdrawal from the inaugural edition of the United Cup took his own teammates by surprise on Wednesday as they were left in the dark until minutes before their pre-tournament news conference. Kyrgios, who is ranked 22nd in the world and reached this year’s Wimbledon final, was set to lead Australia in the joint ATP and WTA event, which is being held in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth and offers ranking points and $15 million in prize-money. Organisers said the 27-year-old, who was due to face Britain’s Cameron Norrie in his first singles match on Thursday in Group D, withdrew due to injury.",Tennis,108,,3,
9,"Kyrgios sparked more controversy after pulling out of the United Cup tennis event at the eleventh hour, and drew a cheeky quip from Stefanos Tsitsipas. I know he doesn't like a lot to play Roland Garros. That's the only tournament that looks like he doesn't like to play that much. The rest of the tournaments, he played final in Wimbledon, and in New York he was close to the finals I think, with a very positive chance.",Tennis,80,,4,
10,"Great Britain face a tough task to qualify for the Davis Cup Finals in 2023 with their February qualifier against Colombia to be played at a venue 2,500 metres above sea level in Bogota. Aside from the high altitude there are more challenges in the way, as the tie will be played on clay - a surface that would be expected to favour the Colombians - and it will come just five days after the conclusion of the Australian Open. GB skipper Leon Smith is yet to select his team for the event but when he does, it could mean a tight turnaround and an arduous travel schedule for the likes of Andy Murray, Cameron Norrie, Jack Draper or Dan Evans.",Tennis,120,,3,
11,"First, players had to wait for the green to clear at the drivable par-4 finisher. Then they had to take photos on the Swilcan Bridge, shuffling in playing partners and life partners and different iterations of coaches and managers and family members. Then they had to study every contour around the front of the iconic green, envisioning a scenario in which they’d get up and down for birdie to win the tournament. It would be tough to design a par-4 with a longer wait.",Golf,86,411,4,18
12,"Adam Scott has confirmed he will join compatriots Cameron Smith and Marc Leishman at the Australian PGA Championship in November; LIV Golfers will be allowed to compete despite the event being co-sanctioned by the DP World Tour. Former Masters champion Adam Scott said he does not see the controversial LIV Series as 'pure evil' for the game of golf and called on the Saudi-backed circuit and the PGA Tour to move on from their feud. LIV Golf has lured away some of golf's biggest names with huge sums of money, while those who joined the rebel circuit were suspended by the PGA Tour. The breakaway circuit has filed a lawsuit accusing the PGA Tour of antitrust violations, while the PGA Tour Tour has filed a counterclaim. ",Golf,129,,3,
13,"The fact that we were able to do something under the lights that never before happened in our sport, to be able to grow it in a different way. Using just a 5-wood on a one-club challenge on the 455-yard, par-4 fourth hole, JT somehow makes par. JT and Spieth are 3-up after four holes.",Golf,60,,3,
14,"The face of professional golf was facing an uncertain future, too. Tiger Woods had already left town; two days had passed since his emotional walk up the 18th hole. With both Woods’ health and the Open’s schedule still up in the air, it’s not clear we’ll see Tiger on The Old again. In all, Sunday felt like the last day of school.",Golf,62,,4,
15,"We played St. Andrews’ Duke’s Course that morning, a parkland setup just outside of town that works its way through the woods but offers sweeping views back towards St. Andrews proper. It was a sweltering Scottish summer day — our cabbie told us it was the hottest he’d ever seen — so after we showered up and dropped our things at Sean’s flat, we set off for town. What followed was a glorious afternoon.",Golf,74,,4,
16,"When it comes to men's 3x3, there has only been one powerhouse. That's Serbia, of course, who cemented their status after double delight this year, where they won the Crelan FIBA 3x3 World Cup 2022 and FIBA 3x3 Europe Cup 2022.  With Stojacic, Majstorovic and Brankovic in the line-up, Serbia had already built-in chemistry and they were further strengthened by the inclusion of Liman big fella Mihailo Vasic, who gave them strength in the paint.  Serbia have an embarrassment of riches with a host of other stars unlucky not to crack the team. They've now won five World Cups and four consecutive Europe Cups to underline their continual dominance of men's 3x3.",Basketball,118,581,5,21
17,"Coming off their NBA Finals run in 2021, the Suns were expected to potentially get back there again in 2022, but ultimately flamed out against Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks in the second round. It was a painful loss for, not only us Suns fans but all NBA fans, as a Suns vs Warriors series in the Western Conference Finals would have been immense. Although the season did end on that sour note, it was in fact a historically great season for Phoenix. They were far and away the most consistent team all season boasting a top-five offensive and defensive rating. This efficiency helped them win a franchise-record 64 games, leading the NBA, with the next closest team being the Grizzlies with 56 wins.",Basketball,127,,5,
18,"James Harden has vowed to get back to his high-scoring best for the Philadelphia 76ers after instructing president of basketball operations Daryl Morey to build a contender around him and Joel Embiid. The former league MVP said he would be happy to take a pay cut to allow the team to build a title-contending roster and he's been true to his word, agreeing a cut-price deal which has helped allow Morey time to put the pieces together to allow the Sixers to go full-tilt at winning a championship. Harden has now fully agreed to a two-year, $68.6m deal with the Philadelphia 76ers, ESPN reported on Wednesday. He averaged 22 points this past season for Brooklyn and Philadelphia, the lowest since he became a starter in the 2012-13 season. He turns 33 in August.",Basketball,141,,4,
19,"Stephen Curry has built up an extensive catalog of accolades, honors, scoring records and personal milestones during his glittering NBA Finals career. But as the stardust settled on his virtuoso 43-point display on Friday, many were left convinced they'd just witnessed the greatest performance of them all by the Golden State Warriors superstar. The 34-year-old shrugged off a sore foot to carry the Warriors to a 107-97 victory on the road against the Boston Celtics, squaring the best-of-seven series at 2-2 and yanking precious momentum back to Golden State, who host two of the three remaining games in San Francisco.",Basketball,108,,3,
20,"Star Indian player, Princepal Singh has stated that he will enroll himself in the National Basketball Association draft next year. The 6-foot-9 forward on Tuesday made history by being part of the Sacramento Kings' squad that went on to win the 2021 NBA Summer League. This made him the first Indian in NBA history to be part of a championship roster at any level of the NBA. The Kings dominated the championship game against the Boston Celtics, clinching the title with a 100-67 win.",Basketball,87,,4,
