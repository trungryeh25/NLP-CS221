1,"Cody Gakpo boosted his appeal with three goals in five appearances at the World Cup - but why did Liverpool want to sign the 23-year-old forward and where will he play? They have reached an agreement to sign the Netherlands international for a fee between £35m and £45m from PSV Eindhoven, beating rivals Manchester United to his signature. Liverpool have looked to bring in another attacking player following long-term injuries to Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota in a bid to finish in the Premier League top four following a patchy start to the season.",Sport,96,354,3,9
2,"United's preparations were disrupted by a virus which left Raphael Varane, who had only just returned from World Cup duty with France, as their only fit centre-back, with Erik ten Hag having to use left-back Luke Shaw alongside him. But Forest rarely tested their makeshift backline, and, in United's first Premier League game since Cristiano Ronaldo's departure, Rashford took centre stage, dispatching the opener from Christian Eriksen's clever corner in the 19th minute, then teeing up Anthony Martial for the second goal shortly afterwards. Forest's Ryan Yates saw a goal ruled out for offside by VAR shortly before half-time, but United were otherwise dominant and wrapped up the win when the excellent Casemiro stole possession high up the pitch and fed substitute Fred, who lashed home a powerful finish three minutes from time.",Sport,141,,3,
3,"The victory ensures United resume their Premier League campaign in the best way possible, closing the gap to Spurs as they chase a top-four finish, while Forest remain 19th, a point from safety. The warning signs were there for Nottingham Forest from the first few minutes of the game, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Tyrell Malacia finding space on the flanks and the latter seeing a powerful effort turned onto the post by Wayne Hennessey. The goalkeeper, standing in for the on-loan Dean Henderson against his parent club, was fortunate that shot didn't squirm into the net rather than onto the upright, but United didn't have to wait long to make the breakthrough.",Sport,117,,3,
4,"This sounds like the cue for the old Formula 1 technology plug – and it is. Indeed, along with other associated slaver-worthy stuff such as ‘motorsport derived’, ‘closed-deck construction’, ‘hand-mad’, ‘one man – one engine’, ‘NANOSLIDE-coated cylinder liners’ and ‘all-aluminium crankcase’. This new unit shares the A 35’s 1991cc cubic capacity and transverse mounting but, other than that, precious little else – even having been installed 180 degrees the other way round for better ducting of both intake and exhaust air. Though that does sound like an admission that the A 35’s unit is the wrong way round.",Car,103,204,4,8
5,"However, that’s not to say that the Auris estate isn’t a useful, hassle-free machine. The sheer volume of interior space will be very handy for those with a lot to lug around, and that hybrid powertrain – while not the least bit exciting – should reduce reliance on the pumps. Which is excellent news now that they have a tendency to run dry. Those large wheels made the ride unsettled and threw up a fair bit of tyre noise at motorway speeds; the peace you get driving one through city streets quickly goes away when you venture out of town.",Car,101,,4,
6,"Fashion shows must always go on—even when it snows. When it comes to braving the elements, be it flurries or a blizzard, street stylers trek rely on winter-proof—and stylish—furs and puffers. There is always someone who is willing to risk frostbite to make a fashion statement in a mini skirt or bare skin.",Fashion,54,133,3,6
7,"Y2K style fully came back this year—see Katie Holmes’s dress-over-jeans as proof. Best described as a flared, gathered, or pleated piece of fabric at the waist of a garment, the adornment really took off in the early 2010s. Lanvin’s spring 2010 collection had ruffled cocktail dresses with exaggerated peplums; Jil Sander’s spring 2011 show had colorful looks with peplum on tees and floor-length skirts; Alexander McQueen’s spring 2012 collection even had peplum waists on structural suits.",Fashion,79,,3,
8,"A Covid-19 ‘senior wave’ is driving up hospitalizations. When Linda Stewart felt a tickle in her throat a few weeks ago, she got worried. She’s a 76-year-old woman, and she was well aware of the risks posed to her and her husband’s health by Covid-19, flu and other colds that are sweeping the United States amid a rough respiratory virus season.",Health,65,247,3,12
9,"The new study included data on more than 200,000 patients seen at 38 children’s hospitals across the United States between October 1, 2015 and February 29, 2020. The data came from the Pediatric Health Information System, an administrative database of children’s hospitals. The researchers examined how many visits included diagnoses of mental health disorders or intentional self-harm. They also analyzed mental health revisits, meaning a patient visited the emergency department again within six months of their initial visit. The ongoing surge in pediatric mental health emergency department visits may be associated with “a combination of factors, including a worsening crisis of pediatric mental illness and shortage of mental health clinicians,” the researchers wrote.",Health,116,,5,
10,"Will it extend your life by removing a fast-growing tumor? Will your quality of life improve by making it easier to walk? Will it prevent you from becoming disabled, akin to a hip replacement?
