1,"Palace leave the pitch to moans and groans from the home fans. It's been 45 minutes of football lacking in quality at Selhurst Park. Mistakes have been made by both sides, but Fulham capitalised to give themselves the advantage at the break. Decordova-Reid's glancing header was quickly followed by Mitchell's sending off in nightmare few minutes for Palace.",Sport,62,887,4,40
2,"Mitchell takes a bad touch and tries to make up for it, but is late on Tete with his studs up. The 23-year-old looks gutted as he leaves the pitch with his head in his shirt. It wasn't a nice challenge, but there was no malice there. Palace's task just got that much harder.",Sport,58,,3,
3,"It was a very un-Kane performance on his return to club football, but ruthlessly effective. Kane had fewer touches than any of Tottenham's outfield starters, making fewer passes too. For a striker who can be criticised for being too involved in the build-up, it was a rarity to see him this quiet. But just as the headlines about World Cup hangovers were starting to form, up he popped with a bullet header past David Raya to spark yet another Spurs comeback this season.",Sport,86,,4,
4,"After every game we do sessions, even during the World Cup. He always makes sure that he is on time and he is ready for it, focused on his development. He thinks about his game but not only about his game. He reads books. He is a very smart guy.",Sport,50,,4,
5,"It had been 45 days since both sides were in Premier League action but the two teams had warmed up nicely for the festive fixture in the East Midlands, having won their midweek Carabao Cup fourth-round ties to then be drawn against each other in the quarter-finals. But Leicester, who were once again without the injured James Maddison due to a new knee injury, were caught cold as Daniel Amartey brought down Joelinton after just 90 seconds to give the visitors a penalty. Wood, deputising for the unwell Callum Wilson, hammered home from the spot to give Newcastle a third-minute lead. Four minutes later, Almiron added a second in sublime fashion as he played a lovely one-two with Bruno Guimaraes and then beautifully slotted past Danny Ward to continue his outstanding form this season.",Sport,138,,4,
6,"It was a reminder of how Liverpool can cut through the opposition with high quality and with Villa opting for a high defensive line there were opportunities throughout. But the home side caused plenty of problems at the other end - and it made for a great game.Watkins wasted a couple of chances and Leon Bailey miskicked when well placed. It proved costly when Salah teed up Van Dijk to measure the ball into the net on his left foot, the strike finding its way past Robin Olsen after deflecting off defender Ezri Konsa.",Sport,94,,4,
7,"Arteta said: 'Thank you so much for him coming and hopefully walking through the building he is going to feel everything that everybody thinks of him, everything that he left here, but also his presence is something that has to be very attached to this football club. So, thank you for doing that because it means a lot to every body at the club. Obviously, it's great and winning my mood is going to be better to speak to him and be around the team. He picked the right moment. It's a really special day because Boxing Day is a beautiful day to play football and I thought the performance today was at a level that he deserved and that hopefully he would like.'",Sport,126,,5,
8,"Following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo and as the January transfer market approaches, Manchester United are looking for forward players but there is a significant chance they will not sign anyone next month. Sky Sports News has been told PSV Eindhoven forward Cody Gakpo, who was a summer target, is one of a few forward players United have been interested in. Gakpo impressed at the World Cup as he scored three goals for Netherlands in Qatar before they were knocked out at the quarter-final stage by Argentina on penalties. United are wary of unrealistic valuations being put on potential targets in January - especially after a World Cup.",Sport,108,,4,
9,"Stewart was sent off after giving away a penalty during Aberdeen's 3-1 defeat to St Mirren on Saturday and has since responded to a comment made on Instagram. Aberdeen were leading 1-0 in Paisley before Stewart - who joined the club in the summer from Wycombe Wanderers - gave away the spot-kick which drew St Mirren level. The hosts went onto win, meaning Aberdeen have lost all three games since the Scottish Premiership resumed following the World Cup. Jim Goodwin's side remain third in the league, ahead of Hearts on goal difference.",Sport,95,,4,
10,Manchester United are prepared to break a transfer record to land goalkeeper Diogo Costa. Harry Kane was mocked by Brentford fans who sung 'you let your country down' during their clash with Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday. Chelsea have been handed a boost in their transfer pursuit of Youssoufa Moukoko. Chelsea are also considering a stunning move to sign Joao Felix on loan in the January transfer window.,Sport,70,,4,
11,"There’s no doubt about it, the new Z is a handsome car; crisply surfaced, neatly proportioned and with a star quality several leagues beyond its $49,990 sticker price (in Performance spec; the lesser Sport starts at just $39,990, or £35,000). The Rays wheels (19 inches front and rear, unique to the Performance) don’t hurt, and nor do the nods to the five-decades-old-and-counting Z dynasty: the 350Z-inspired vertical slashes to the front end; the cute S30-inspired headlights; the gorgeous 300ZX-cribbed slatted tail lights. Everything else about the Z is engineered with a reassuring heft, from the clutch (an Exedy unit, paired with a carbon propshaft on Performance models) to the gearbox to the way it moves on the road. The six-speed manual slots positively into first (a nine-speed auto is the other option), the traction control’s off before the first Stop sign and, after a few exploratory fizzes of wet-tarmac wheelspin, the Nissan and I feel like best friends.",Car,171,1214,4,41
12,"The electric revolution is changing the face of the car industry at breakneck speed. The Volkswagen Group is at the forefront of the transformation – and here’s a new ace up its sleeve, the rugged Scout EV brand and its proposed electric pick-up. Our rendering, by computer artist Andrei Avarvarii, uncovers the battery-powered truck on the drawing board for a 2026 launch. It’s aimed squarely at the likes of the Ford F-150 Lightning and Rivian R1T: practical, puritanical utility vehicles that remove tailpipe emissions from the great outdoors. Insiders at the VW Group have given a few details of the spec to whet our appetites: the Scout electric double-cab pick-up blueprint is built around a steel and aluminium monocoque with a dual-motor powertrain providing up to 469bhp of grunt and all-wheel drive to lug serious cargo in its flatbed loadbay.",Car,147,,5,
13,"Mazda has been selling the MX-30 electric SUV since 2020 – but the big question is: have you noticed? Sales of the first fully electric Mazda have been modest to say the least. And we’re not sure the mildly tweaked 2022 variant is going to make much difference. While on the one hand that’s a little sad – the MX-30 is a good-looking compact crossover, with a beautifully built interior and that beautifully simply Mazda infotainment system – on the other it’s entirely unsurprising. For Mazda, in its infinite wisdom, has delivered a modern EV with a tiny 35.5kWH battery pack and utterly underwhelming 124-mile official driving range. Which, as we all know, means you’ll be lucky to get a 100 miles out of it in the real world, assuming you’re taking a trip on a moderately balmy day.",Car,144,,5,
14,"It’s a highly complex piece of kit which needs to be set up properly to deliver. This set-up procedure takes time since it involves selecting one of eight drive modes (new to the AMG game are Electric and Battery Hold), four recuperation stages, three ESP settings and four AMG Dynamics programmes labelled Basic, Advanced, Pro and Master, which in turn control numerous sub-functions, including three different steering calibrations. The day kicks off on the private Ascari race track close to the Spanish Golden Coast. For the test drive, Mercedes has selected the shortest of three loops, reducing the laptime to roughly two minutes by avoiding the second longest straight. We can only guess, but since maximum boost expires theatrically after a 10-second showdown, two flat-out sections in a row might have prematurely exhausted the system.",Car,139,,5,
15,"Porsche will sell the next-generation electric Macan alongside existing models with internal combustion engines (ICE); the final petrol-powered models will roll off the production line in 2024 – and after that it’ll be just Macan EVs available. Our artist’s impression by Andrei Avarvarii (above) strips away the disguise to show how it’ll look at launch. Porsche’s decision to sell an electric version of the new Macan alongside ICE-powered models shows that the brand isn’t ready to throw its full weight behind full electrification. The company recognises that electrification isn’t right for everyone just yet, so it’ll tailor the sales of its electric Macan to the markets most willing to accept it.",Car,114,,4,
16,"Like most EVs, performance when you prod the accelerator is immediate and substantial. But full ‘throttle’ does not last – find a long straight, sink your right foot to the floor and the boost is sudden and severe, yet fades after about 10 seconds. Asked nicely, the new Merc ESQ SUV 580 will whoosh silently in 4.6sec from 0-62mph and on to a top speed of 131mph – that’s only half a second less brisk than the EQS saloon. Blame the bigger frontal area and extra mass. While the middle-ranking 450 4Matic does the job in six seconds flat, the entry-level 450+ loses another squealing seven tenths during take-off.",Car,114,,4,
17,"If our two-day test drive in speed-restricted North America is anything to go by, our Mercedes EQS SUV review suggests a range of 250 to 300 miles is realistic, while the average waiting time at a 200kW charger is half an hour – that’s okay, but not nearly as quick as the 800-volt rivals from Korea. Air suspension and rear-wheel steering are part of the package, but note that the pop-up third row of seats, which shrinks the luggage space to a token 195 litres, is an option. With only the first row of seats upright, boot space is a colossal 2100 litres. The EQS SUV’s steering is on the light side, but it makes the big car feel smaller, and there is no artificial flavouring in the software pie.",Car,135,,4,
18,"The new Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV hides its considerable heft remarkably well. Handling is as failsafe as can be when 2735kg of weight and up to 633lb ft of forward thrust arrive jointly at the force times distance T-junction. Hairpins are a hoot, thanks to rear-wheel steering and the chassis somehow conspires to make you forget you’re driving a tip-toe-tall SUV.",Car,65,,3,
19,"The car itself isn’t massively different – the Corolla still comes as a family hatchback or Touring Sports estate in the UK (a saloon is available elsewhere). We’ve been driving the former. A new set of lights front and rear results in tweaked bodywork and redesigned bumper elements, still covered in camouflage in the pictures – smacking slightly of drawing attention to something that otherwise wouldn’t be noticeably different – while there are also minor revision to the crash structure and the suspension.",Car,83,,3,
20,"The lithium-ion battery pack has a 14% greater output, a 14% (18kg) lower weight and is more compact. The control electronics are more efficient and quieter. And the electric motors are more powerful – the one in the Corolla 1.8 jumping 23bhp to 94bhp, the one in the 2.0 increasing 4bhp to 111bhp – while also being 16kg and 18kg lighter, respectively. All told, this results in the 1.8-litre Corolla now delivering 138bhp combined – up from 120hp – while the 2.0-litre Corolla rises from 181bhp to 193bhp. CO2 drops to 102 and 107g/km",Car,102,,4,
21,"If last year was all about Emily’s style, now we’re looking to Sylvie for inspiration. The former Savoir boss (whose outfits are rumored to be influenced by Carine Roitfeld) works Parisian style like nobody’s business in a wardrobe heavy on form-fitting midi skirts, one-shouldered-dresses, embroidered blazers, and classic button-down shirts from labels like Alexandre Vauthier, Alaïa, and Saint Laurent. Below we track Sylvie-esque flair on the streets of the French capital. Scroll through to get in the mood for Emily in Paris, and follow our Street Style Trend Tracker for the best looks from the season.",Fashion,101,861,4,39
22,"This year, vintage fashion took center stage on the red carpets and in paparazzi shots of celebrities. Whether they were attending a major event or not, Hollywood A-listers made archival fashion feel entirely modern, proving that a well-cut design can stand the test of time. There were a few stars who made vintage designs their 2022 signature. Two standouts from Zendaya were the black Valentino strapless gown she wore to the Emmys, and the sculptural, strapless Bob Mackie gown in black and teak (from fall 1998) that she wore to a Time 100 Gala.",Fashion,96,,4,
23,"Model Bella Hadid is also a noted fan of pre-loved fashion (she’s known to browse Depop, after all). At the Cannes Film Festival, she wore a white Tom Ford-era Gucci column gown with a hip cutout, and a frothy fall 1986 Chanel gown. The thing that Zendaya and Hadid have in common? They were both styled by Law Roach, who has an eye for throwback finds. 'No matter if it was made in 1920 or 2020, a great dress is a great dress,' Roach told Vogue last month.",Fashion,90,,5,
24,"Given her status as a style icon, it’s no surprise that Jackie Kennedy’s dazzling engagement ring has provided inspiration for countless brides over the years. The toi_et_moi design from French jeweller Van Cleef & Arpels comprised a 2.88-carat diamond and a 2.84-carat emerald, both emerald-cut, on a band of baguette-cut emeralds and diamonds. Not afraid to put her own stamp on the design, the First Lady actually redesigned the piece nearly a decade after their wedding, replacing the baguettes with flashier marquise-cut diamonds that tapered to round-cut diamonds on the side.",Fashion,94,,3,
25,"The Los Angeles-based writer, vintage dealer, and social editor at Old Navy is well-versed in fashion history, and matches her 'understated melodrama, aesthetic with witty and at times touching captions. An Electric Feathers pale mint dress with a fanned-out sleeve (that she’s styled with black leather Tabi boots) she describes as, 'CATEGORY IS: Turn of the century ERTÉ muse decamps from GAY PARIS to settle down in SILVERLAKE'.  In another Instagram, Marks wears a crinkly Dries van Noten blouse with puffed, Charles Worth-style sleeves with the caption 'we’re currently in the “PUTTING ON A SILLY LITTLE OUTFIT JUST TO FEEL LIKE YOUR MERE EXISTENCE IS POSSIBLE” stage of things'. ",Fashion,113,,3,
26,"She wore a long Moncler puffer coat, sensible light-wash jeans, and simple Stan Smith sneakers. Her bag was fantastic, though unrecognizable. It wasn’t covered in a monogram nor a teensy logo (as far as I could see). It was black, square, and discreet. But this anonymous medium-size piece was of obviously stellar quality: Kevlar-thick leather, a sturdy shape, and over-the-shoulder practical.",Fashion,66,,5,
27,"A bag has the power to uplift, elevate, and pull together an outfit. It’s a status symbol, whether you’re an exec hauling a Louis Vuitton Neverfull, a fashion girl parading a Bottega Veneta lime green Cassette, or a vintage lover clutching the horn handle of a Yves Saint Laurent Mombasa. I often think of Mary-Kate Olsen who carries a trusty, well-worn, and recognizable Hermés Kelly bag. The visible everyday use combined with the knowledge of how much that bag must cost speaks volumes about Olsen and how she approaches fashion.",Fashion,92,,4,
28,"Younger customers are hankering for things from the ’80s and the ’90s. Her ready-to-wear is so relevant to today and to a younger generation, and her eveningwear, and her corsetry, is exceptional. We’ve done well with classic coats, like those in cashmere from The Row. Outerwear from Saint Laurent is strong, especially when it comes with those big shoulders: You’re covered up, but still making a statement. Saint Laurent has been one of my favorite collections of the last few seasons.",Fashion,83,,4,
29,"Grace Breuning on Walking Chanel and the Decline of Curve-Model Castings. This most recent fashion month marked the unencumbered return of full-throated, high-production presentations from brands, but it also signaled a potentially worrisome trend. A lack of size diversity was felt, with many commentators and writers wondering if hard-fought gains toward greater size inclusivity in shows and campaigns were being eroded overnight. Still, there were meaningful and exciting debuts of curve models in the fray.",Fashion,79,,4,
30,"Are Portia’s Outfits on The White Lotus Good or Bad? Over the past few weeks, Portia’s style has quickly become one of the show’s most hotly-debated topics, notably on Twitter. Meanwhile, no outfits have sparked this much contentious discussion among Vogue’s fashion news team this year. ",Fashion,47,,3,
31,"Flu, Covid-19 and RSV: Tracking hospitalizations this brutal virus season. Influenza hospitalizations surged this fall: The cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 residents, compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has eclipsed at least five of the past 12 seasons. While the seven-day rolling average of hospitalization cases derived from US Health and Human Services’ data has come down in recent weeks, experts warn a resurgence is possible as people travel and gather for the holidays. While Covid levels remain far below prior surges, trends are definitely on the rise across the US, according to data the US Department of Health and Human Services. After a relatively quiet summer, hospitalizations have been on the rise again since early November.",Health,124,896,5,40
32,"Mental health-related emergency department visits and revisits are on the rise among children, study finds. Emergency department visits and revisits in children’s hospitals that are related to mental health are 'increasing rapidly', a new study suggests. Between 2015 and 2020, mental health visits in pediatric emergency departments increased by 8% annually, with about 13% of those patients revisiting within six months, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. Whereas, all other emergency department visits increased by 1.5% annually.",Health,84,,4,
33,"We read a sparkling headline about some promising new drug that might help patients with Alzheimer’s disease. We also hear about failed drug trials and reversals of promises that a cure-all is in sight. I wrote a book about how to keep your brain sharp that came out two years ago. Since then, not much has changed in our understanding of how we can preserve our memories, and the lessons remain as relevant as ever. But one thing has become abundantly clearer: Preventing and even treating forms of dementia are largely driven by lifestyle and the choices we make daily.",Health,101,,5,
34,"Respiratory viruses could surge following the holidays, public health experts warn. There is growing concern among infectious disease and public health experts that the US could face even more respiratory infections in January. It is 'highly likely' that respiratory viruses could spread even more following holiday gatherings and New Year’s Eve celebrations, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Monday. When that happens, 'People are together for very long periods of time, and they’re not wearing masks, and they’re weary and tired and stressed, and those are occasions where people are more apt to spread the virus', Schaffner said, adding that his own granddaughter had four flights canceled over the holidays.",Health,133,,4,
35,"Larry McMahon is weighing whether to undergo a major surgery. Over the past five years, his back pain has intensified. Physical therapy, muscle relaxants, and injections aren’t offering relief.",Health,29,,3,
36,"Older adults contemplating major surgery often aren’t sure whether to proceed. In many cases, surgery can be lifesaving or improve a senior’s quality of life. But advanced age puts people at greater risk of unwanted outcomes, including difficulty with daily activities, extended hospitalizations, problems moving around, and the loss of independence.",Health,51,,3,
37,"The Pillowfort brand blankets can trap children inside if they unzip them and enter the blanket, posing a risk of suffocation. Two girls, ages 4 and 6, reportedly died after becoming entrapped in the cover of the blanket in April 2022 at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Target has received four reports of children becoming entrapped in these weighted blankets, including the two deaths. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission and Target are urging consumers to stop using the recalled blankets immediately and return them to stores for a refund.",Health,89,,4,
38,"Researchers make important progress toward a possible universal flu vaccine. Influenza is continuing its early and severe rampage through the United States, but there’s some hopeful news for flu seasons of the future. In a significant step, researchers recently said they’ve been able to immunize animals against all 20 known influenza A and B virus strains, marking an important step toward the goal of a single vaccine against all types of the flu. Our current flu vaccines prime the body to protect against four strains: two influenza A strains and two B strains. The composition of these vaccines is changed each year in anticipation of which strains will make most people sick during the coming season.",Health,116,,4,
39,"Certain strains are known to circulate among humans, but many more circulate in animals and scientists worry that these viruses could jump to humans – suddenly exposing us to viruses our immune systems have never seen. That’s where a universal flu vaccine would help. The idea is that these multivalent shots could prep the body to recognize these viruses, should any of them take off in humans, helping prevent severe illness and death. Several universal flu vaccines are in various stages of development and testing, including one at the National Institutes of Health.",Health,93,,4,
40,"To make the vaccine, the researchers relied on the same mRNA technology that’s used in Covid-19 vaccines. But scientists actually started on these experiments in 2017, years before the first Covid-19 shots were given. In fact, it was that research that helped lay the groundwork for the Covid-19 vaccines. In the quest for a universal flu vaccine, scientists have been carefully studying flu viruses, looking for structural regions that are similar among strains.",health,76,,4,
