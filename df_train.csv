1,"Palace leave the pitch to moans and groans from the home fans. It's been 45 minutes of football lacking in quality at Selhurst Park. Mistakes have been made by both sides, but Fulham capitalised to give themselves the advantage at the break. Decordova-Reid's glancing header was quickly followed by Mitchell's sending off in nightmare few minutes for Palace.",Football,62,887,4,40
2,"Mitchell takes a bad touch and tries to make up for it, but is late on Tete with his studs up. The 23-year-old looks gutted as he leaves the pitch with his head in his shirt. It wasn't a nice challenge, but there was no malice there. Palace's task just got that much harder.",Football,58,,3,
3,"It was a very un-Kane performance on his return to club football, but ruthlessly effective. Kane had fewer touches than any of Tottenham's outfield starters, making fewer passes too. For a striker who can be criticised for being too involved in the build-up, it was a rarity to see him this quiet. But just as the headlines about World Cup hangovers were starting to form, up he popped with a bullet header past David Raya to spark yet another Spurs comeback this season.",Football,86,,4,
4,"After every game we do sessions, even during the World Cup. He always makes sure that he is on time and he is ready for it, focused on his development. He thinks about his game but not only about his game. He reads books. He is a very smart guy.",Football,50,,4,
5,"It had been 45 days since both sides were in Premier League action but the two teams had warmed up nicely for the festive fixture in the East Midlands, having won their midweek Carabao Cup fourth-round ties to then be drawn against each other in the quarter-finals. But Leicester, who were once again without the injured James Maddison due to a new knee injury, were caught cold as Daniel Amartey brought down Joelinton after just 90 seconds to give the visitors a penalty. Wood, deputising for the unwell Callum Wilson, hammered home from the spot to give Newcastle a third-minute lead. Four minutes later, Almiron added a second in sublime fashion as he played a lovely one-two with Bruno Guimaraes and then beautifully slotted past Danny Ward to continue his outstanding form this season.",Football,138,,4,
6,"It was a reminder of how Liverpool can cut through the opposition with high quality and with Villa opting for a high defensive line there were opportunities throughout. But the home side caused plenty of problems at the other end - and it made for a great game.Watkins wasted a couple of chances and Leon Bailey miskicked when well placed. It proved costly when Salah teed up Van Dijk to measure the ball into the net on his left foot, the strike finding its way past Robin Olsen after deflecting off defender Ezri Konsa.",Football,94,,4,
7,"Arteta said: 'Thank you so much for him coming and hopefully walking through the building he is going to feel everything that everybody thinks of him, everything that he left here, but also his presence is something that has to be very attached to this football club. So, thank you for doing that because it means a lot to every body at the club. Obviously, it's great and winning my mood is going to be better to speak to him and be around the team. He picked the right moment. It's a really special day because Boxing Day is a beautiful day to play football and I thought the performance today was at a level that he deserved and that hopefully he would like.'",Football,126,,5,
8,"Following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo and as the January transfer market approaches, Manchester United are looking for forward players but there is a significant chance they will not sign anyone next month. Sky Sports News has been told PSV Eindhoven forward Cody Gakpo, who was a summer target, is one of a few forward players United have been interested in. Gakpo impressed at the World Cup as he scored three goals for Netherlands in Qatar before they were knocked out at the quarter-final stage by Argentina on penalties. United are wary of unrealistic valuations being put on potential targets in January - especially after a World Cup.",Football,108,,4,
9,"Stewart was sent off after giving away a penalty during Aberdeen's 3-1 defeat to St Mirren on Saturday and has since responded to a comment made on Instagram. Aberdeen were leading 1-0 in Paisley before Stewart - who joined the club in the summer from Wycombe Wanderers - gave away the spot-kick which drew St Mirren level. The hosts went onto win, meaning Aberdeen have lost all three games since the Scottish Premiership resumed following the World Cup. Jim Goodwin's side remain third in the league, ahead of Hearts on goal difference.",Football,95,,4,
10,Manchester United are prepared to break a transfer record to land goalkeeper Diogo Costa. Harry Kane was mocked by Brentford fans who sung 'you let your country down' during their clash with Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday. Chelsea have been handed a boost in their transfer pursuit of Youssoufa Moukoko. Chelsea are also considering a stunning move to sign Joao Felix on loan in the January transfer window.,Football,70,,4,
11,"Novak Djokovic has arrived in Australia nearly a year after he was deported from the country, ahead of his bid for a 10th men's singles title at next month's Australian Open. Djokovic landed in Adelaide where he is due to play in the Adelaide International beginning on Sunday. The 35-year-old was deported on the eve of the 2022 tournament in Melbourne after he arrived in the country without being vaccinated against Covid-19. Djokovic's representatives and Tennis Australia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",Tenis,92,1182,4,41
12,"Original Nine special guests at Aus Open. Billie Jean King and members of the Original Nine will be special guests at the Australian Open in 2023 and headline the AO Inspirational Series on Thursday 26 January 2023. Signing a symbolic $1 contract, they formed their own professional tour which led to increased prize money for women's tennis and the eventual formation of what we now know as the WTA Tour. Julie Heldmen and Nancy Richey are unable to make the long trip to Australia but send their best wishes. The Original Nine transformed women’s tennis and made a huge impact on women’s sport around the world.",Tenis,107,,5,
13,"The partnership with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) welcomes tennis back to Sky Sports and reaffirms the broadcaster as the home of live sport in the UK and Ireland. The new agreement will begin with the 2023 US Open at Flushing Meadows, starting on August 28, with Sky Sports holding the exclusive broadcast rights up to and including the 2027 event. We are very excited to partner with the USTA once again to deliver the US Open, one of the greatest Grand Slam tennis tournaments in the world. We have had a great history with the USTA and remember Andy Murray's 2012 US Open win as one of the great moments on Sky Sports. This is another huge sporting event for our viewers, and we look forward to bringing tennis fans more of what they love and welcoming in new fans to the sport. ",Tenis,146,,5,
14,"Tennis pioneer Billie Jean King says Emma Raducanu would benefit using a sports psychotherapist as she bids to regain the form that took her to last year's US Open title. The 19-year-old called an early halt to her WTA Tour season after a problem with her wrist last month in a year plagued by injuries. Raducanu is now focussing on the physical work that was clearly lacking this season under the tutelage of Andy Murray's former trainer Jez Green, with her next scheduled event set for Abu Dhabi on December 16 in a pre-season exhibition. Raducanu, who sent the tennis world into a spin when she came through qualifying, not dropping a set in 10 matches to win at Flushing Meadows, has struggled on her first full season on the Tour.",Tenis,136,,5,
15,"She went out in the first round at the US Open and the second round of the other three Grand Slams. The British No 1 has also dropped to 76th in the WTA rankings having broken into the top 10 in July. As well as injuries, Raducanu has had a succession of changes to her coaching set-up, with Dmitry Tursunov the latest to part ways with the teenager. 'Now I think that she needs to have space and time and talk to people she trusts', King said ahead of the Billie Jean King Cup Finals which start next week in Glasgow.",Tenis,102,,4,
16,"Known as one of the most decorated players in the history of the sport, Federer's competitive career is about to end and the sport of tennis must move forwards without an icon. He's written his legacy into tennis folklore already and now is the time to celebrate a glorious career. Aged 21, Federer got his hands on his first major title and it came at his beloved All England Club with an elegant array of shotmaking in a 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 7-6 (7-3) demolition of Mark Philippoussis in the final - a star was born! Having never got past the quarter-finals in any Grand Slam it came as a 'relief' to Federer, who unleashed a torrent of tears upon winning the title.",Tenis,129,,4,
17,"Federer dominated the 2004 season, imposing his superiority on men's tennis, winning three Grand Slam singles titles, becoming the first person to do so since Mats Wilander in 1988. He celebrated becoming world No 1 for the first time in his career by beating Russian Marat Safin in a one-sided Australian Open final in Melbourne 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 6-2. And in the summer, Federer claimed his third major and second title at the All England Club with a 4-6 7-5 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 victory against American opponent Andy Roddick. And in the summer, Federer claimed his third major and second title at the All England Club with a 4-6 7-5 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 victory against American opponent Andy Roddick.",Tenis,135,,4,
18,"Serena Williams not only dominated the women's game but she has continued to be on the forefront of the international sporting landscape as a mother, icon, and leader. World No 1 for 319 weeks and winner of 23 Grand Slam singles titles, Williams announced her retirement from professional tennis after a third-round defeat to Ajla Tomljanovic at the US Open - more than 25 years after making her Tour debut. We are privileged to have observed Serena rule the roost in a golden era of tennis.",Tenis,87,,3,
19,"The former US Open champion is searching for her fifth coach in 16 months after her Russian coach Tursunov decided against extending his stay beyond his current deal. Raducanu, who turns 20 next month, enjoyed some promising results under Tursunov, including reaching the semi-final of the Korea Open in Seoul last month. However she has continued to suffer injury setbacks in a stop-start season, retiring midway through her last-four clash with Jelena Ostapenko with a glute injury and withdrawing from last week's Transylvania Open with a wrist problem.",Tenis,92,,3,
20,"Andrew Richardson helped Raducanu to US Open glory after their fairy-tale win together in 2021 before Jeremy Bates stepped in for Indian Wells last year with German Torben Beltz, who helped Angelique Kerber reach world No 1, then coming on board. She turned to Tursunov ahead of her 2022 US Open defence, but with that partnership at an end all thoughts have quickly turned to who the British No 1 will bring on board next. I wasn't surprised in the end because I sort of felt with the stages of where they were at in terms of Raducanu's tennis and Tursunov in terms of his coaching, he had just come out working with Aryna Sabalenka and Anett Kontaveit ahead of Wimbledon. I think things changed with Raducanu's ranking and where Tursunov's from - there were complications with potential visas and I think it was probably best for both parties in the end.",Tenis,156,,4,
21,"Spain's Adrian Otaegui, who successfully challenged sanctions imposed by the DP World Tour for competing in LIV Golf events, cruised to a commanding victory in the Andalucia Masters. Otaegui took a six-shot lead into the final round at Valderrama and was never in danger of being caught, a closing 68 giving him a tournament-record total of 19 under par. Sweden's Joakim Lagergren also shot 68 to finish six shots behind, with Australia's Min Woo Lee another three strokes back in third. Otaegui was one of three players added to the field for July's Genesis Scottish Open after appealing against their suspensions for playing in the inaugural LIV event in Hertfordshire.",Golf,116,1136,4,39
22,"Keegan Bradley secured his first PGA Tour victory in four years at the Zozo Championship as fellow American Rickie Fowler's title drought extended. Bradley - previously winless since the 2018 BMW Championship - shot a two-under-par 68 to end on 15 under for the tournament and scoop close to $2 million. Overnight leader Fowler finished on 14 under after a level round of 70, with Andrew Putnam also on 14 under after a final-round 68 at the Narashino Country Club in Japan. It is closing in on four years since Fowler claimed the most recent of his five PGA Tour successes - the Waste Management Phoenix Open in February 2019.",Golf,111,,4,
23,"World number eight Lexi Thompson fired a three-under-par final round of 69 to win the individual title at the Aramco Team Series – New York by three shots. Thompson started the final day with a one-shot lead over compatriot Nelly Korda, and she held off the chasing pack. The American carded three bogeys but also hit six birdies to finish on 11 under. Canada's Brooke Henderson and Sweden's Madelene Sagstrom finished in second place overall, after finishing eight under. Thompson took control with back-to-back birdies on 10 and 11, before birdies on 15 and 17, and even a bogey on the last could not spoil the party as she clinched a three-shot victory.",Golf,121,,5,
24,"DP World Tour members who played on the Saudi-funded rebel circuit without permission were banned from the Scottish Open and hit with individual fines of £100,000. However, following a hearing before Sport Resolutions (UK), the suspensions imposed on Otaegui, Ian Poulter and Justin Harding were temporarily stayed, pending determination of their substantive appeals. Otaegui played three of the first four LIV events but it is not clear if he will play any further tournaments.",Golf,76,,3,
25,"Hidalgo carded eight birdies, including seven in a nine-hole stretch around the turn, and narrowly failed to chip in for another on his final hole which would have seen him equal Bernhard Langer's 28-year-old course record. The world number 325's total of nine under par was matched late in the day by compatriot Adrian Otaegui and in-form Australian Min Woo Lee, who finished second here last year and was third in the Spanish Open on Sunday. Lee added a 67 to his opening 66, with Otaegui's scores recorded the other way around.",Golf,99,,3,
26,"I've been working extremely hard on my game. I felt like it was a matter of time, but I just wanted to play golf and put myself in contention in the final rounds and learn from the losses that I had and what I needed to work on, and I brought that into today. Today, I just the way I played yesterday with aggressive golf, and kind of fiery. I hit a great shot on number one to six or seven feet and made it. I wanted to play fearless golf and not play away from pins by any means and commit to my shots.",Golf,106,,5,
27,"Rickie Fowler will take a one-stroke lead into the final round of the Zozo Championship at Narashino Country Club as he looks to secure a first win in three years. The five-time PGA Tour winner, playing on a sponsor's exemption, fired a third-round 66 to sit at 14 under, just ahead of fellow American Keegan Bradley. It could have been even better for Fowler, but he dropped a shot on the par-four 15th before recovering for a birdie on the final hole, despite finding the bunker off the tee, to stay in front of the chasing pack. Andrew Putnam is third, two off the lead, after he could only manage a 68 having shot a bogey-free 62 on Friday.",Golf,125,,4,
28,"US Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick vowed to risk a more aggressive approach after a poor start to the defence of his Andalucia Masters title. Fitzpatrick claimed his seventh DP World Tour title at Valderrama last year, but struggled to an opening three-over-par 74 on Thursday to lie eight shots off a five-way tie for the lead and four behind younger brother Alex. England's David Horsey holds a share of the lead after an opening 66 which included seven birdies and a double bogey. Fitzpatrick still rates Valderrama as a 'great golf course' and believes patience will remain the key for players in contention.",Golf,107,,4,
29,"The BMW PGA Championship counts as one of the events Garcia needs to play to remain a DP World Tour member, but the former Masters champion remained one short of the required four this season. The Spaniard failed to enter next week's Mallorca Golf Open, and although he could receive an invitation to that event or the Nedbank Golf Challenge in November, that appears unlikely. Only DP World Tour members can be selected for the Ryder Cup, meaning that the contest's record points scorer could have made his last appearance for Team Europe. His singles win over Rickie Fowler in 2018 made him the top points scorer in Ryder Cup history with 25.5, and he won three more alongside Jon Rahm in the 19-9 defeat at Whistling Straits last year.",Golf,134,,4,
30,"Steele made an early birdie at the second and ended a run of pars by starting his back nine with successive gains, before cancelling out a bogey at the par-five 14th by converting from five feet at the next. The American rolled in from 10 feet at the 16th and produced a slam-dunk birdie from 60 yards at the par-four 17th, after a wayward drive left him punching out of the trees, with Steele then signing off his round with a two-putt birdie at the par-five last. Schenk made a bogey-free start to the week and grab solo second and Bradley matched Steele's four-birdie finish to stay within two of the lead, while Fowler - playing on a sponsor's exemption - is three off the pace and tied-sixth after an opening-round 67.",Golf,141,,3,
31,"Doncic did indeed score a monstrous 60-point triple-double, the first of its kind in the NBA. That's 60 points, 21 rebounds, 10 assists, all racked up against the New York Knicks in Tuesday's night's 126-121 overtime victory. In doing so, the 23-year-old becomes the youngest player to achieve such an accolade - a record previously held by none other than Wilt Chamberlain (26). Chamberlain would have been smiling down on Doncic's magic, as he wove his way through and around the Knicks defence, even at one point, hitting a jump shot with one second remaining, after intentionally missing a free throw to send the game into overtime. He certainly had the fans, media attendance, and players on both sides spellbound, with the NBA twitter sphere just as mesmerised.",Basketball,136,991,5,40
32,"Nikola Jokic had 41 points, 15 rebounds and 15 assists, Aaron Gordon added 28 points and 13 rebounds and the host Denver Nuggets beat the Phoenix Suns 128-125 in overtime on Sunday night. Jamal Murray scored 26 points and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 15 for the Nuggets, who have won four straight. Ayton opened overtime with a 14-footer but Denver responded with the next eight points to go ahead 121-115 with 2:30 left. Shamet hit two 3-pointers around one by Caldwell-Pope and Ayton sank a reverse layup to make it 124-123 with 1:02 left.",Basketball,102,,4,
33,"Back with a bang atop the East Conference standings, it was once again the mesmerising duo of Jayson Tatum and Jalen Brown who demoted the Bucks, with a 121-109 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. It was a much-needed win after the Celtics racked up consecutive defeats to the Orlando Magic and appeared in turmoil ahead of the Christmas run-in with four losses in five games. Fortunately, Tatum and Brown, who scored 23 of his 36 points on Friday in the fourth quarter, was able to help turn things around. His team will need more of the same when they face off the Bucks in a tantalising Christmas Day match-up.",Basketball,113,,5,
34,"All-Star voting officially opened on the December 20, and with it, the NBA season's action became that bit more enticing. When it comes to which players will make the starting five for the game on February 19 in Salt Lake City, there are plenty of intriguing individuals to sift through. The Indiana Pacers star is on par to complete the season averaging at least 19 points and 10 assists, while shooting over 38 per cent from deep - a feat that only Michael Jordan and Chris Paul have achieved. Haliburton's silky ballhandling and fast transition moves have made him a painfully difficult opposition for defenders across the league (just ask the Miami Heat). Whether it's exploding with a franchise-record 10 three-pointers in a game, or shooting from within the paint, the accuracy and efficiency at which he does so, makes him a prime backcourt contender.",Basketball,150,,5,
35,"The Milwaukee Bucks and the Boston Celtics cannot decide who wants to top the East Conference standings. Leaders last week, MVP frontrunner Giannis Antetokounmpo and co have now returned as the number two seed after their 118-100 defeat to the Brooklyn Nets on Friday. In doing so, they handed over an eighth consecutive victory to their opponents, who are now operating in their longest active winning streak since 2012.",Basketball,70,,3,
36,"Do not be fooled by their positioning in our standings. Since the return of Jarrett Allen, the Cavs have quietly risen to 6-2, reinstating their defensive strengths with victory over the Utah Jazz this week. Operating on a four-game winning streak, it seems that the stars might be finally lining up for Donovan Mitchell and co ahead of this February's All-Star game.",Basketball,66,,3,
37,"Jamal Murray scored 26 points and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 15 for the Nuggets, who have won four straight. Landry Shamet tied his career high with 31 points for Phoenix. Deandre Ayton had 22 points and 16 rebounds, Chris Paul amassed 17 points and 16 assists, Damion Lee scored 18 and Torrey Craig and Mikal Bridges had 13 points each. The Suns lost Devin Booker to a groin injury just 4:20 into the game.",Basketball,75,,4,
38,"You will be hard-pressed to find someone who works - and works out - more, than Giannis (if you are not familiar with ladder-gate, go look it up). The man is a beast on both ends of the court, averaging 31.2 points per game, as well as 11.2 rebounds in defensive transitions. Aside from the obvious physique qualities, Giannis has played a huge role in the Milwaukee Bucks' positioning atop the Eastern Conference with his ballhandling skills. With him leading the charge, the Bucks have gone toe to toe with the dominant Boston Celtics, which is exactly the reason why he commands the perfect frontcourt starter position.",Basketball,109,,4,
39,"The Cleveland Cavaliers were on a five-game winning streak before Pascal Siakam's Toronto Raptors brought them spinning back to earth. Amidst the highs and lows, however, there has been one constant: a fit and healthy Donovan Mitchell, doing Donovan Mitchell things. Averaging 28.9 points a game, and consistently performing alongside Darius Garland, Mitchell is shooting at 50.3 per cent, and will likely only improve as the play-in's approach. He is another prime pick for a frontcourt position, not just because of his reliable hands, but also his selflessness and compatibility.",Basketball,96,,4,
40,"I'm Nathan, I'm a stand-up comedian and a Toronto Raptors fan and have been so since 2000 when I saw Vince Carter compete in the All-Star Slam Dunk Contest. It was like the culmination of a perfect storm. I had been a basketball fan since the mid-90s but never had a team, but as soon as I saw the man dubbed 'half man, half amazing' it made total sense.",Basketball,74,,3,
