1,"Palace leave the pitch to moans and groans from the home fans. It's been 45 minutes of football lacking in quality at Selhurst Park. Mistakes have been made by both sides, but Fulham capitalised to give themselves the advantage at the break. Decordova-Reid's glancing header was quickly followed by Mitchell's sending off in nightmare few minutes for Palace.",Football,62,2277,4,89
2,"Mitchell takes a bad touch and tries to make up for it, but is late on Tete with his studs up. The 23-year-old looks gutted as he leaves the pitch with his head in his shirt. It wasn't a nice challenge, but there was no malice there. Palace's task just got that much harder.",Football,58,,3,
3,"It was a very un-Kane performance on his return to club football, but ruthlessly effective. Kane had fewer touches than any of Tottenham's outfield starters, making fewer passes too. For a striker who can be criticised for being too involved in the build-up, it was a rarity to see him this quiet. But just as the headlines about World Cup hangovers were starting to form, up he popped with a bullet header past David Raya to spark yet another Spurs comeback this season.",Football,86,,4,
4,"After every game we do sessions, even during the World Cup. He always makes sure that he is on time and he is ready for it, focused on his development. He thinks about his game but not only about his game. He reads books. He is a very smart guy.",Football,50,,4,
5,"It had been 45 days since both sides were in Premier League action but the two teams had warmed up nicely for the festive fixture in the East Midlands, having won their midweek Carabao Cup fourth-round ties to then be drawn against each other in the quarter-finals. But Leicester, who were once again without the injured James Maddison due to a new knee injury, were caught cold as Daniel Amartey brought down Joelinton after just 90 seconds to give the visitors a penalty. Wood, deputising for the unwell Callum Wilson, hammered home from the spot to give Newcastle a third-minute lead. Four minutes later, Almiron added a second in sublime fashion as he played a lovely one-two with Bruno Guimaraes and then beautifully slotted past Danny Ward to continue his outstanding form this season.",Football,138,,4,
6,"It was a reminder of how Liverpool can cut through the opposition with high quality and with Villa opting for a high defensive line there were opportunities throughout. But the home side caused plenty of problems at the other end - and it made for a great game.Watkins wasted a couple of chances and Leon Bailey miskicked when well placed. It proved costly when Salah teed up Van Dijk to measure the ball into the net on his left foot, the strike finding its way past Robin Olsen after deflecting off defender Ezri Konsa.",Football,94,,4,
7,"Arteta said: 'Thank you so much for him coming and hopefully walking through the building he is going to feel everything that everybody thinks of him, everything that he left here, but also his presence is something that has to be very attached to this football club. So, thank you for doing that because it means a lot to every body at the club. Obviously, it's great and winning my mood is going to be better to speak to him and be around the team. He picked the right moment. It's a really special day because Boxing Day is a beautiful day to play football and I thought the performance today was at a level that he deserved and that hopefully he would like.'",Football,126,,5,
8,"Following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo and as the January transfer market approaches, Manchester United are looking for forward players but there is a significant chance they will not sign anyone next month. Sky Sports News has been told PSV Eindhoven forward Cody Gakpo, who was a summer target, is one of a few forward players United have been interested in. Gakpo impressed at the World Cup as he scored three goals for Netherlands in Qatar before they were knocked out at the quarter-final stage by Argentina on penalties. United are wary of unrealistic valuations being put on potential targets in January - especially after a World Cup.",Football,108,,4,
9,"Stewart was sent off after giving away a penalty during Aberdeen's 3-1 defeat to St Mirren on Saturday and has since responded to a comment made on Instagram. Aberdeen were leading 1-0 in Paisley before Stewart - who joined the club in the summer from Wycombe Wanderers - gave away the spot-kick which drew St Mirren level. The hosts went onto win, meaning Aberdeen have lost all three games since the Scottish Premiership resumed following the World Cup. Jim Goodwin's side remain third in the league, ahead of Hearts on goal difference.",Football,95,,4,
10,"It was obviously a thrilling match, with no certainty of outcome right until the final whistle and from that point of view, many will have enjoyed it. On the other hand, those tasked with improving the defensive side of the game for either team won’t be too happy with what they saw. Joe Gomez started in the heart of defence for Liverpool along with Joel Matip, with Virgil van Dijk being one of the players rested after their exploits at the World Cup. Trent Alexander-Arnold was another one of those, which meant veteran James Milner starting at right-back.",Football,100,,4,
11,"Like Nunez, Palmer showed a lack of composure in front of goal, missing some glorious chances to put the ball in the back of the net. But he showed a fine level of understanding of the way Guardiola wants his forward line to play, and his ability to combine with far more experienced teammates was very notable. He may not be as expensive as Jack Grealish yet, but his presence in the starting XI ahead of the former Aston Villa man certainly didn’t make City look any weaker.",Football,88,,3,
12,"Here's a rumour that won't go away. PSG are said to have coveted Inter's star center back since last summer. The club reportedly tabled a €65m (£57m/$69m) offer for the defender, but Inter didn't budge. It was a testy time for PSG, as Galtier was reportedly unhappy with the ownership for botching negotiations.",Football,58,,4,
13,"When LaLiga resumes this week, it will do so with Barcelona sitting top of the table. A 2-1 comeback win against Osasuna in November ensured they spent the World Cup two points clear of Real Madrid. There is then a nine-point gap to third-placed Real Sociedad which means, following brief disturbances from Atletico Madrid in recent years, this season will once again be a Clasico shootout for the title.",Football,72,,3,
14,"Jiri missed a routine backhand in the ninth game and faced a break point. He saved it with a service winner and missed a game point that would cost him dearly. The Czech netted a forehand to face the second break point, and the American converted it after a beautiful rally that pushed him 5-4 in front. Fritz served for the victory in game ten and sealed the deal with an ace to earn the first victory of the new season.",Football,82,,4,
15,Manchester United are prepared to break a transfer record to land goalkeeper Diogo Costa. Harry Kane was mocked by Brentford fans who sung 'you let your country down' during their clash with Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday. Chelsea have been handed a boost in their transfer pursuit of Youssoufa Moukoko. Chelsea are also considering a stunning move to sign Joao Felix on loan in the January transfer window.,Football,70,,4,
16,"When LaLiga resumes this week, it will do so with Barcelona sitting top of the table.

17,"Fernandez is one of the continent's most sought-after players after his dazzling displays for Argentina at the World Cup. The 21-year-old scored a beauty against Mexico in the group stages and was a vital cog in Lionel Scaloni's side, with his performances earning him the Young Player of the Tournament award and helping the Albiceleste to their first World Cup since 1986. Despite a stellar tournament in Qatar, Fernandez has been keen to quash the multitude of rumours surrounding his potential exit from Benfica. However, with Chelsea matching the player's release clause, Correio de Manha are reporting that the Argentina starlet could leave as early as January, as the Blues look to revitalise an ageing midfield with both Jorginho and N'Golo Kante out of contract in the summer and unlikely to renew.",Football,139,,4,
18,"The 23-year-old scored in each of the Netherlands’ three group games at the World Cup and, prior to the break, was the Eredivisie’s leading scorer with nine goals and had produced the most assists with 12. He had a medical on Merseyside on Tuesday and Wednesday prior to finalising a deal that will see him officially become a Liverpool player on 1 January. Gakpo returned to training at the end of last week after the World Cup and, subject to a work permit, should be eligible to make his debut at Brentford on Monday, although the FA Cup tie at home to Wolves on 7 January appears a more realistic target.",Football,113,,3,
19,"After enduring a lengthy slump dating back to at least Euro 2020, Rashford's latest performance pushed him to six goals and an assist since the start of November for club and country. Behind Rashford, Casemiro was a key force for Manchester United and even registered a late assist following a dogged defensive midfield effort. The Red Devils are now just a point behind Tottenham for fourth place with a game in hand, which is a best-case scenario for Erik ten Hag considering the club's putrid start to the season.",Football,92,,3,
20,"As the game hit the final 15 minutes, Bournemouth began to grab control, but still could not break down the Saints. Down the other end, Rodriguez would put the feather in the cap. With five minutes left, Redmond split three defenders and worked very hard to get the ball at the top of the box, and Rodriguez cleaned up the mess by volleying a stunner into the top corner to put the game away.",Football,74,,3,
21,"Juventus fans have been left confused and irritated by Paul Pogba sharing pictures of himself enjoying the slopes over the festive period. The midfielder, who is still yet to feature for the Italian giants since re-joining in the summer, is recovering from the thigh injury that ruled him out of action for his club and then Les Bleus for the World Cup.  And according to Tuttosport, Juventus fans are 'agitated' by the social media posts, especially given the active pursuits on mountains when he is out injured. ",Football,88,,3,
22,"Mbappe, who scored a 95th-minute penalty to win the game for PSG on Wednesday night, couldn't help but make a pointed jab at Martinez by claiming Argentina team-mate Lionel Messi was a 'good sportsman' – suggesting Martinez was not. 'I talked with him (Messi) after the match (World Cup), I congratulated him,' Mbappe added. 'It was a life's goal for him, for me as well, but I failed, so you must always remain a good sportsman. 'Personally, I will never get over it (losing the final). But my club is not responsible for this failure of our team, (so) I've tried to return with the most positive energy possible'.",Football,114,,3,
23,"The Frenchman is another player who has revived his United career under Ten Hag, and is the closest thing the manager feels he has to a No.9. Martial was one of United's brightest performers on tour in the summer before he suffered three separate injuries, and has already scored five goals in nine appearances this season. However, Martial's erratic form has been a source of frustration throughout his time at Old Trafford, and an inability to stay fit could also be an issue if Ten Hag has to rely on him for the rest of the season.",Football,100,,3,
24,"Neymar saw his return to club football cut short after he was shown a second yellow card in as many minutes for a dive in the penalty box as PSG beat Strasbourg 2-1 on Wednesday night.  The Brazilian forward was one of several World Cup stars to start the game for the Ligue 1 leaders, but unlike Kylian Mbappe - who sealed the points with a late penalty - he failed to shine for his club.  Les Parisiens were without Lionel Messi who is still celebrating his World Cup victory in Argentina and were almost punished for Neymar's theatrics but an added time spot-kick allowed Mbappe to seal all three points on the night.",Football,115,,3,
25,"JACK GAUGHAN: With 134 caps for Croatia, six appearances at major tournaments and a house full of trophies, Shakhtar Donetsk sporting director Darijo Srna has been around the block. He was one of the best right backs in Europe for more than a decade, so is well placed to critique left wingers. After retiring in 2019, Srna is in a suit these days and thinks Shakhtar's jewel in the crown - the explosive Mykhailo Mudryk - is as good as it gets out wide.",Football,83,,3,
26,"Novak Djokovic has arrived in Australia nearly a year after he was deported from the country, ahead of his bid for a 10th men's singles title at next month's Australian Open. Djokovic landed in Adelaide where he is due to play in the Adelaide International beginning on Sunday. The 35-year-old was deported on the eve of the 2022 tournament in Melbourne after he arrived in the country without being vaccinated against Covid-19. Djokovic's representatives and Tennis Australia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",Tennis,92,2375,4,96
27,"Original Nine special guests at Aus Open. Billie Jean King and members of the Original Nine will be special guests at the Australian Open in 2023 and headline the AO Inspirational Series on Thursday 26 January 2023. Signing a symbolic $1 contract, they formed their own professional tour which led to increased prize money for women's tennis and the eventual formation of what we now know as the WTA Tour. Julie Heldmen and Nancy Richey are unable to make the long trip to Australia but send their best wishes. The Original Nine transformed women’s tennis and made a huge impact on women’s sport around the world.",Tennis,107,,5,
28,"The partnership with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) welcomes tennis back to Sky Sports and reaffirms the broadcaster as the home of live sport in the UK and Ireland. The new agreement will begin with the 2023 US Open at Flushing Meadows, starting on August 28, with Sky Sports holding the exclusive broadcast rights up to and including the 2027 event. We are very excited to partner with the USTA once again to deliver the US Open, one of the greatest Grand Slam tennis tournaments in the world. We have had a great history with the USTA and remember Andy Murray's 2012 US Open win as one of the great moments on Sky Sports. This is another huge sporting event for our viewers, and we look forward to bringing tennis fans more of what they love and welcoming in new fans to the sport. ",Tennis,146,,5,
29,"Tennis pioneer Billie Jean King says Emma Raducanu would benefit using a sports psychotherapist as she bids to regain the form that took her to last year's US Open title. The 19-year-old called an early halt to her WTA Tour season after a problem with her wrist last month in a year plagued by injuries. Raducanu is now focussing on the physical work that was clearly lacking this season under the tutelage of Andy Murray's former trainer Jez Green, with her next scheduled event set for Abu Dhabi on December 16 in a pre-season exhibition. Raducanu, who sent the tennis world into a spin when she came through qualifying, not dropping a set in 10 matches to win at Flushing Meadows, has struggled on her first full season on the Tour.",Tennis,136,,5,
30,"She went out in the first round at the US Open and the second round of the other three Grand Slams. The British No 1 has also dropped to 76th in the WTA rankings having broken into the top 10 in July. As well as injuries, Raducanu has had a succession of changes to her coaching set-up, with Dmitry Tursunov the latest to part ways with the teenager. 'Now I think that she needs to have space and time and talk to people she trusts', King said ahead of the Billie Jean King Cup Finals which start next week in Glasgow.",Tennis,102,,4,
31,"Known as one of the most decorated players in the history of the sport, Federer's competitive career is about to end and the sport of tennis must move forwards without an icon. He's written his legacy into tennis folklore already and now is the time to celebrate a glorious career. Aged 21, Federer got his hands on his first major title and it came at his beloved All England Club with an elegant array of shotmaking in a 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 7-6 (7-3) demolition of Mark Philippoussis in the final - a star was born! Having never got past the quarter-finals in any Grand Slam it came as a 'relief' to Federer, who unleashed a torrent of tears upon winning the title.",Tennis,129,,4,
32,"Federer dominated the 2004 season, imposing his superiority on men's tennis, winning three Grand Slam singles titles, becoming the first person to do so since Mats Wilander in 1988. He celebrated becoming world No 1 for the first time in his career by beating Russian Marat Safin in a one-sided Australian Open final in Melbourne 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 6-2. And in the summer, Federer claimed his third major and second title at the All England Club with a 4-6 7-5 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 victory against American opponent Andy Roddick. And in the summer, Federer claimed his third major and second title at the All England Club with a 4-6 7-5 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 victory against American opponent Andy Roddick.",Tennis,135,,4,
33,"Serena Williams not only dominated the women's game but she has continued to be on the forefront of the international sporting landscape as a mother, icon, and leader. World No 1 for 319 weeks and winner of 23 Grand Slam singles titles, Williams announced her retirement from professional tennis after a third-round defeat to Ajla Tomljanovic at the US Open - more than 25 years after making her Tour debut. We are privileged to have observed Serena rule the roost in a golden era of tennis.",Tennis,87,,3,
34,"The former US Open champion is searching for her fifth coach in 16 months after her Russian coach Tursunov decided against extending his stay beyond his current deal. Raducanu, who turns 20 next month, enjoyed some promising results under Tursunov, including reaching the semi-final of the Korea Open in Seoul last month. However she has continued to suffer injury setbacks in a stop-start season, retiring midway through her last-four clash with Jelena Ostapenko with a glute injury and withdrawing from last week's Transylvania Open with a wrist problem.",Tennis,92,,3,
35,"Andrew Richardson helped Raducanu to US Open glory after their fairy-tale win together in 2021 before Jeremy Bates stepped in for Indian Wells last year with German Torben Beltz, who helped Angelique Kerber reach world No 1, then coming on board. She turned to Tursunov ahead of her 2022 US Open defence, but with that partnership at an end all thoughts have quickly turned to who the British No 1 will bring on board next. I wasn't surprised in the end because I sort of felt with the stages of where they were at in terms of Raducanu's tennis and Tursunov in terms of his coaching, he had just come out working with Aryna Sabalenka and Anett Kontaveit ahead of Wimbledon. I think things changed with Raducanu's ranking and where Tursunov's from - there were complications with potential visas and I think it was probably best for both parties in the end.",Tennis,156,,4,
36,Lehecka painted a forehand winner at the start of the second set and landed another from his backhand in game two for a break chance. Fritz denied it with a service winner and held after a couple of deuces for 1-1. Lehecka produced his fifth comfortable service game in a row with an unreturned serve that sent him 2-1 in front.,Tennis,63,,3,
37,Taylor followed that pace with a hold at 15 in game four before Jiri landed a volley winner at the net for 3-2. Lehecka stepped in on the second serve return and created a break chance in the sixth game. Fritz denied it with a fine attack and a smash winner at the net.,Tennis,55,,3,
38,"Djokovic missed the Grand Slam last year because of his refusal to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Australia has since lifted strict rules for unvaccinated travelers. Immigration Minister Andrew Giles last month confirmed that Djokovic, who had been facing a possible three-year ban after being deported, was granted a visa. Djokovic has won the Australian Open a record nine times, including the last three times he played. Rafael Nadal won the 2022 title in Djokovic's absence.",Tennis,78,,5,
39,Fritz made his way into the top 10 in October for the first time in his career in a year where he turned in his best performances in grand slams. He reached the fourth round of the Australian Open and quarter-finals at Wimbledon. The 25-year-old had a superb 6-3 7-6 win over Rafael Nadal at this year's Indian Wells Masters to confirm his upward trajectory.,Tennis,71,,3,
40,"Sinner now wants to build on that next season. 'I don't look too much at the rankings, but at improving—the ranking will follow', he told Corriere del Veneto. 'But I certainly aim to be at the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin in front of the Italian fans. It would mean being in the best eight players of the year, and having had a very good season'.",Tennis,67,,4,
41,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe spent six years in jail before being freed in March after Britain agreed to pay a longstanding debt to Iran. She was imprisoned for allegedly plotting to overthrow the Iranian government and for propaganda against Iran, charges she has always denied. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 44, was asked to be one of the guest editors of the Today programme on BBC Radio Four during the Christmas and New Year period and in that capacity interviewed British tennis great Murray in an edition broadcast Wednesday.",Tennis,85,,3,
42,"The Australian Open next month will be his first opportunity of the year, a tournament where the Spaniard is defending champion. 'I know he doesn't like a lot to play Roland Garros, that's the only tournament that looks like he doesn't like to play that much', said Nadal in Sydney. The rest of the tournaments, he played final in Wimbledon, in New York he was close with the quarter-finals I think, with a very positive chance.",Tennis,80,,3,
43,"Her first came eight years ago against fellow Czech Karolina Pliskova before she lifted the Sydney International trophy once again against retired Australian superstar Ash Barty in 2019. 'When we got into the United Cup, I was wishing we could play in Sydney', Kvitova said before the Czech Republic’s first match of the United Cup on Thursday afternoon. 'We can’t wish for more. I have great memories from here. It’s always the best, and I’m looking forward to sharing this beautiful centre court with my teammates'.",Tennis,86,,3,
44,"Djokovic said he still has difficulty forgetting his deportation. 'Obviously what happened 12 months ago was not easy for me, for my family, team, anybody who is close to me. It's obviously disappointing to leave the country like that', he said. 'You can't forget those events. It's one of these things that stays with you for I guess the rest of your life. It's something that I've never experienced before and hopefully never again. But it is a valuable life experience for me and something that as I said will stay there, but I have to move on'.",Tennis,103,,5,
45,"Dominic Thiem's comeback from wrist surgery is gaining momentum heading into 2023. The 29-year-old Austrian fell below the Top 300 this season but then turned around his play to return to the Top 100, reaching three ATP semifinals. Now he's looking to get back to the top of the game again, speaking to the Abu Dhabi National while playing the World Tennis League in Dubai this week.",Tennis,71,,3,
46,"Erving in the first set at 4-5, 15-30, the Austrian chased down a lob and then whipped a forehand crosscourt passing shot by Mirza. Soon the set went to a tiebreaker, where Thiem was also the commanding figure, he and Pavlyunchenkova capturing it, 7-4. The two broke early in the second and stayed in charge. Serving at 5-3, 40-15, Thiem struck a service winner down the T to wrap up the match.",Tennis,77,,4,
47,"Swiatek’s defeat had come at the hands of Elena Rybakina. This was an intriguing matchup between two superb practitioners of contemporary power tennis. While Swiatek had shown wire-to-wire brilliance all year, most notably by winning at Roland Garros and the US Open, Rybakina’s bright shining moment had come on tennis' biggest stage, when she’d taken the title at Wimbledon. Long-term performance favored Swiatek. But on this occasion, Rybakina was the one thoroughly in control. After taking a 3-0 lead to start, Rybakina lost the next three games, but then snapped back into from, closing out the set with an ace, sliced wide in the deuce court. ",Tennis,110,,4,
48,"With Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic not participating, Rafael Nadal will take center stage among the men. He has a lot to live up to: Last year he was perfect Down Under, winning an Australian Open warm-up event, and then the Australian Open itself. It seems possible that 2023 could be Rafa’s last, or next-to-last, season; he’ll turn 37 in June, and he was sidelined with injury for months at a time in 2022. He’ll play his first match on the 31st, against Cam Norrie.",Tennis,88,,4,
49,"Djokovic missed the Grand Slam last year because of his refusal to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Australia has since lifted strict rules for unvaccinated travelers. Immigration Minister Andrew Giles last month confirmed that Djokovic, who had been facing a possible three-year ban after being deported, was granted a visa.Djokovic has won the Australian Open a record nine times, including the last three times he played.

The Czech netted a forehand to face the second break point, and the American converted it after a beautiful rally that pushed him 5-4 in front. Fritz served for the victory in game ten and sealed the deal with an ace to earn the first victory of the new season.",Tennis,82,,3,
51,"Phil Mickelson has reached this unwanted milestone in the World Ranking for the first time in 30 years. Mickelson had just turned pro in the summer of ‘92, following his third individual NCAA title while playing at Arizona State, and his first event as a pro was the 1992 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach. Mickelson finished runner up to Brad Faxon at that New England Classic, held in late July, jumping from World No. 266 to No. 175. He then spent the rest of his pro career until two weeks ago inside the top 200 in the world, including a career-best best ranking of No. 2.",Golf,108,2607,5,98
52,"The fall outside the top 200 comes after Mickelson dropped out of the top 100 in March of 2021 the first time he’d been out of the top 100 since 1993. Months later, Mickelson won the 2021 PGA Championship at the age of 50 for his sixth major title, catapulting from 115 to 32 on the rankings. Earlier this year, Mickelson’s ranking plummeted when he took a four-month hiatus from competitive golf due to inflammatory comments he made in 2021 that were published in early February.",Golf,87,,3,
53,"The comments were about the PGA Tour and LIV Golf’s financiers, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. In a 2021 phone conversation with golf writer Alan Shipnuck, Lefty acknowledged the 'horrible record on human rights' in Saudi Arabia but said he could help 'reshape' the PGA Tour using 'leverage' from the rival league. Mickelson returned to golf at the U.S. Open at Brookline in June, after he’d joined LIV Golf courtesy of a guaranteed money that was estimated in reports to be almost $200 million. With LIV Golf not yet earning OWGR ranking points, Mickelson played only six times on the PGA Tour in 2021-22, with a top finish of T-30 in the Sentry Tournament of Champions. He missed four straight cuts, including at the U.S. Open and Open Championship.",Golf,133,,5,
54,"When you think of golf hotbeds in the United States, places like Florida, California and Arizona come to mind given the sheer number of golf courses found in each state. Yet according to data the USGA mined from the World Handicap System, none of the three can boast having the lowest average Handicap Index. In fact, they don’t even rank in the top.",Golf,63,,3,
55,"Nope, if you’re looking for the state with the best golfers on average for 2022, head over to the southeast portion of the country and check out: Mississippi. Combining all the male and female golfers with handicap indexes in the Magnolia State, their average index is an impressive 11.8. Second to Mississippi is another state that might surprise you. Golfers in North Dakota average a 12.4 Handicap Index to rank No. 2 in the U.S. Coming in third is Oklahoma with a 12.8 Handicap Index.",Golf,89,,4,
56,"Arizona, as it turns out, ranks 28th with a 16.3 average Handicap Index among all the state’s golfers, with California ranking 39th (16.8) and Florida coming in at 48th (19.0). Mind you, there are reasonable explanations for why these three states would rank so low. All three have among the biggest golf populations, meaning while they might have more single-digit handicappers, they’ll have more high handicappers as well, weighing down the average. Florida, with its large number of retirees, particularly gets hurt by the law of averages.",Golf,91,,4,
57,"You remember that Scottie Scheffler won the Masters, that Tiger Woods returned to golf (while possibly saying goodbye to St. Andrews), that Phil Mickelson said some things he shouldn’t have said. But it’s been a busy year in golf, so big that perhaps you forgot all that happened. This brief quiz on the year that was in the sport will put your memory to the test.",Golf,66,,3,
58,"Spieth reached the milestone first with his win at the RBC Heritage, while Thomas—who captured his second Wanamaker at the PGA Championship—joined him later that summer. After blowing a two-shot lead with three holes to play, allowing Chun to win the KPMG Women’s PGA, Thompson and Hye-Jin Choi were informed by LPGA officials that they’d been fined for slow play. The group was put on the clock with two holes remaining during the final round, a round that took nearly six hours to complete. For those of you with lives, Beergate started when a photo of the concession prices at Southern Hills went viral. Those prices include $15 for a Kona Golden Ale, $18 for Michelob Ultra and $19 for Stella Artois.",Golf,124,,5,
59,"Smith made an unofficial 253 feet during his second round at St. Andrews, topping the mark of Brent Geiberger at the 2006 Booz Allen Classic. However, we’ll also accept 'D' as a correct answer. The clubhouse at Oakland Hills Country Club, site of more than a dozen major championships, suffered extensive damage after being engulfed in flames in February. In March the USGA announced a strategic partnership with the iconic Detroit-area facility that features a slate of eight championships, including the U.S. Open in 2034 and 2051.

60,"Woods wore FootJoy golf shoes in his return to professional golf, ultimately making the cut at the Masters. Past Open champions are no longer invited to play after age 60, putting Norman, 67, on the outs. Then again, Norman was also told he was not welcome to the Open’s 150th celebrations, a nod to his role in inciting golf’s civil war.

Tournament officials discovered early in the first round that Matsuyama’s 3-wood with a face that had been covered in white paint—was in possible violation of the rules for applying foreign substance to the club. Under the new Rules of Golf, had Matsuyama not used the club before being notified, he could have continued on. However, Matsuyama used the 3-wood on his opening tee shot, leading to the DQ.",Golf,105,,4,

Meanwhile, the prospect of a new tee box being used on the par-5 13th at Augusta National already has fans anxious for April to get here ASAP. In thinking about the Masters, the natural instinct is also to think about who is playing in the Masters.",Golf,81,,4,
63,"That question became far less muddied in recent days after Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley issued a statement regarding the qualifying process for the 2023 tournament, which settled the matter over whether players connected to the LIV Golf League who are banned from playing on the PGA Tour would be prohibited from playing in the year’s first men’s major as well. Ridley never referred to LIV Golf in the statement and issued a condemnation over the schism in the game that’s arisen in the wake of the launch of the controversial Saudi-backed series.  'Regrettably, recent actions have divided men’s professional golf by diminishing the virtues of the game and the meaningful legacies of those who built it', Ridley wrote. However, while acknowledging being  'disappointed' in these developments,  'our focus is to honor the tradition of bringing together a preeminent field of golfers'.",Golf,143,,4,
64,"Therefore, as invitations are sent this week, we will invite those eligible under our current criteria to compete in the 2023 Masters Tournament', Ridley said. 'As we have said in the past, we look at every aspect of the Tournament each year, and any modifications or changes to invitation criteria for future Tournaments will be announced in April'.

In World Golf Championship events, 550 FedEx Cup points goes to the winner, while 600 points are given to the champion of the four majors and the Players.

Otaegui took a six-shot lead into the final round at Valderrama and was never in danger of being caught, a closing 68 giving him a tournament-record total of 19 under par. Sweden's Joakim Lagergren also shot 68 to finish six shots behind, with Australia's Min Woo Lee another three strokes back in third. Otaegui was one of three players added to the field for July's Genesis Scottish Open after appealing against their suspensions for playing in the inaugural LIV event in Hertfordshire.",Golf,116,,4,
67,"Keegan Bradley secured his first PGA Tour victory in four years at the Zozo Championship as fellow American Rickie Fowler's title drought extended. Bradley - previously winless since the 2018 BMW Championship - shot a two-under-par 68 to end on 15 under for the tournament and scoop close to $2 million. Overnight leader Fowler finished on 14 under after a level round of 70, with Andrew Putnam also on 14 under after a final-round 68 at the Narashino Country Club in Japan. It is closing in on four years since Fowler claimed the most recent of his five PGA Tour successes - the Waste Management Phoenix Open in February 2019.",Golf,111,,4,

Thompson started the final day with a one-shot lead over compatriot Nelly Korda, and she held off the chasing pack. The American carded three bogeys but also hit six birdies to finish on 11 under. Canada's Brooke Henderson and Sweden's Madelene Sagstrom finished in second place overall, after finishing eight under. Thompson took control with back-to-back birdies on 10 and 11, before birdies on 15 and 17, and even a bogey on the last could not spoil the party as she clinched a three-shot victory.",Golf,121,,5,

However, following a hearing before Sport Resolutions (UK), the suspensions imposed on Otaegui, Ian Poulter and Justin Harding were temporarily stayed, pending determination of their substantive appeals. Otaegui played three of the first four LIV events but it is not clear if he will play any further tournaments.",Golf,76,,3,
70,"Hidalgo carded eight birdies, including seven in a nine-hole stretch around the turn, and narrowly failed to chip in for another on his final hole which would have seen him equal Bernhard Langer's 28-year-old course record. The world number 325's total of nine under par was matched late in the day by compatriot Adrian Otaegui and in-form Australian Min Woo Lee, who finished second here last year and was third in the Spanish Open on Sunday. Lee added a 67 to his opening 66, with Otaegui's scores recorded the other way around.",Golf,99,,3,

I felt like it was a matter of time, but I just wanted to play golf and put myself in contention in the final rounds and learn from the losses that I had and what I needed to work on, and I brought that into today. Today, I just the way I played yesterday with aggressive golf, and kind of fiery. I hit a great shot on number one to six or seven feet and made it. I wanted to play fearless golf and not play away from pins by any means and commit to my shots.",Golf,106,,5,
72,"Rickie Fowler will take a one-stroke lead into the final round of the Zozo Championship at Narashino Country Club as he looks to secure a first win in three years. The five-time PGA Tour winner, playing on a sponsor's exemption, fired a third-round 66 to sit at 14 under, just ahead of fellow American Keegan Bradley. It could have been even better for Fowler, but he dropped a shot on the par-four 15th before recovering for a birdie on the final hole, despite finding the bunker off the tee, to stay in front of the chasing pack. Andrew Putnam is third, two off the lead, after he could only manage a 68 having shot a bogey-free 62 on Friday.",Golf,125,,4,
73,"US Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick vowed to risk a more aggressive approach after a poor start to the defence of his Andalucia Masters title. Fitzpatrick claimed his seventh DP World Tour title at Valderrama last year, but struggled to an opening three-over-par 74 on Thursday to lie eight shots off a five-way tie for the lead and four behind younger brother Alex. England's David Horsey holds a share of the lead after an opening 66 which included seven birdies and a double bogey. Fitzpatrick still rates Valderrama as a 'great golf course' and believes patience will remain the key for players in contention.",Golf,107,,4,
74,"The BMW PGA Championship counts as one of the events Garcia needs to play to remain a DP World Tour member, but the former Masters champion remained one short of the required four this season. The Spaniard failed to enter next week's Mallorca Golf Open, and although he could receive an invitation to that event or the Nedbank Golf Challenge in November, that appears unlikely. Only DP World Tour members can be selected for the Ryder Cup, meaning that the contest's record points scorer could have made his last appearance for Team Europe. His singles win over Rickie Fowler in 2018 made him the top points scorer in Ryder Cup history with 25.5, and he won three more alongside Jon Rahm in the 19-9 defeat at Whistling Straits last year.",Golf,134,,4,

The American rolled in from 10 feet at the 16th and produced a slam-dunk birdie from 60 yards at the par-four 17th, after a wayward drive left him punching out of the trees, with Steele then signing off his round with a two-putt birdie at the par-five last. Schenk made a bogey-free start to the week and grab solo second and Bradley matched Steele's four-birdie finish to stay within two of the lead, while Fowler - playing on a sponsor's exemption - is three off the pace and tied-sixth after an opening-round 67.",Golf,141,,3,

That stretch begins with four important games this week: a two-game series against the Nuggets, another home game against the Jazz (Friday), and a visit to Memphis (Sunday).

79,"Warriors grab No. 1 spot from Suns — Lance Stephenson and Joe Johnson signed 10-day contracts with the Hawks and Celtics. Otto Porter Jr. was the late-game hero as the Warriors edged the Suns, Nicolas Claxton thrunked on LeBron James, and Jrue Holiday made some big defensive plays down the stretch against the Celtics on Christmas (when four of the five games were close). Back in the Knicks’ starting lineup after a long time out of the rotation, Kemba Walker had a 44-point performance and a triple-double.",Basketball,91,,3,
80,"After an 0-3 start to their seven-game homestand, the Celtics got an important win over the Wolves on Friday. It wasn’t just important because it ended a 1-5 stretch, but also because the Celtics were able to get a win while shooting poorly (13-for-48, 28%) from 3-point range. They did it by outscoring the Wolves (who rank third in restricted-area point differential per game) by 21 points (66-45) on restricted-area buckets and free throws, with Jaylen Brown (23), Jayson Tatum (21) and Derrick White (14) accounting for 58 of those 66 points. For the season, the Celtics rank just 25th in the percentage of their shots that have come in the restricted area and 20th in free throw rate.",Basketball,128,,4,
81,"The big offensive breakout came on Christmas when Boston scored 139 points on 103 possessions against Milwaukee’s top-five defense. The 3s were falling (the Celtics were 19-for-39 from beyond the arc), Tatum (41 points total) outscored Giannis Antetokounmpo (20-12) on restricted area buckets and free throws, and the Celtics also won the turnover battle. They’re now 16-1 (with 14 straight wins) when they’ve had an assist/turnover ratio of at least 1.9 and 8-9 (with five straight losses) when it’s been lower than 1.9. The Celtics had fallen out of the top spot in offensive efficiency prior to the weekend wins, but they’re back, with another matchup against a top-five defense coming this week.",Basketball,123,,4,
82,"The Celtics’ seven-game homestand wraps with games against the Rockets and Clippers. The Clips are the team with that top-five defense and the team that handed the Celtics their worst loss of the season (20 points) two weeks ago when Boston was without both Al Horford and Robert Williams III. The Cs will then play 10 of their first 13 January games on the road, and a four-game trip begins Sunday with a matchup of the first-place teams in their respective conferences and the league’s top two offenses. The Celtics’ first game against Denver (a 19-point win on Nov. 11 in Boston) was their most efficient offensive game of the season.",Basketball,116,,4,

And the Nuggets have had a strong, eight-game stretch, going 7-1 over the last 18 days, with five of those seven wins having come against other Western Conference teams with winning records. It was written in this space last week that the Nuggets’ next five games could be their biggest stretch of the season, and they’re 3-0 so far, having beat the Grizzlies, Blazers and Suns to complete a 4-0 homestand. The win over Memphis was a little ugly, but the Nuggets remain the only team that hasn’t scored less than a point per possession in a game this season. Michael Porter Jr. was just 2-for-11 from 3-point range in his first two games back from a 13-game absence, but the Nuggets still scored 121 points per 100 possessions over their weekend wins.",Basketball,157,,5,
84,"That included 15 points on 11 possessions in overtime on Sunday, when Aaron Gordon gave us the dunk of the year. It was a risky play in more ways than one, but it was spectacular. Gordon is averaging 17.5 points (the second-highest mark in his nine seasons), with his effective field goal percentage (65.7%) and true shooting percentage (66.9%) being the best marks of his career by wide margins. He’s certainly not the most eager 3-point shooter, but he’s one of two players (Nicolas Claxton is the other) that have shot better than 70% on at least 200 field goal attempts in the paint.",Basketball,109,,4,
85,"The Nuggets have still played the fewest games (they’re 5-3) within the top 12 teams in the league (those that are at least three games over .500). They’ll play three more games within that group this week and, while their schedule remains home-heavy for the next four weeks, their first two meetings with the Kings are in Sacramento. They’re a Tuesday-Wednesday back-to-back and the start of the Nuggets’ only stretch of five games in seven nights this season. Denver has thus far played just two back-to-backs (fewest in the league), but will have three in the next 12 days.",Basketball,106,,4,

He averaged 31.8 points on an effective field goal percentage of 65.3% as the Cavs won five straight games to climb within a game of first place in the Eastern Conference. In his first game against his former team (Monday in Cleveland), Mitchell scored 23 points in less than 23 minutes, shooting 4-for-5 from 3-point range. His shooting from the field wasn’t so great two nights later, but he was 15-for-16 from the line as the Cavs beat the Bucks in a game they led by as many as 26 points.",Basketball,112,,4,

And with that victory over the Bucks, the Cavs are 13-3 (with eight straight wins) when he’s scored 30 points or more. But the five-game winning streak came to an end against Toronto on Friday, when the Cavs surrendered 27 fast break points (the most they’ve allowed since October) and 19 3-pointers (the most they’ve allowed all season). The Raptors (who don’t have a real center of their own) somehow scored 41 points on 22 possessions (186 per 100) with neither Jarrett Allen nor Robin Lopez on the floor (and Evan Mobley at the five).",Basketball,139,,4,

The Grizz thumped the Suns on Friday, but scored just 99 points per 100 possessions (shooting 23.6% from 3-point range) over the three losses. They can often make up for missed shots by crashing the glass (they had a top-five offense while ranking 23rd in effective field goal percentage last season), but losses in Oklahoma City and Denver were their two worst offensive rebounding games of the year. The 1-3 trip knocked the Grizz out of first place and out of the top 10 in offensive efficiency. They’ve still been the league’s best home team, both in regard to record (13-2 – now tied with the Warriors) and point differential per 100 possessions (plus-13.2), but only two teams (the Blazers and Bulls) have played fewer home games than the Grizzlies.",Basketball,195,,5,
89,"Wagner was ejected for a flagrant foul, while Detroit’s Killian Hayes and Hamadou Diallo were thrown out for their actions during the ensuing scuffle in front of the Pistons bench. With 34 seconds left in the first half, Wagner and Hayes chased an errant Magic pass into the backcourt. Wagner knew Orlando would be called for a backcourt violation as soon as he touched it, and as he slowed up to let it go out of bounds, Hayes tried to cut past him along the sideline. Wagner hip-checked Hayes into the Detroit bench, starting a scuffle that involved every player on both teams. Hayes got back up and swung his right arm and struck Wagner, who slumped over and appeared to be unconscious.",Basketball,124,,5,
90,"The 26-year-old Booker has missed six of the past nine games because of hamstring and groin ailments. Phoenix managed to regroup and took the game to overtime but the Nuggets won, 128-125. The Suns topped the Memphis Grizzlies 125-108 on Tuesday night, but Booker was not present for that game either. After the game, coach Monty Williams would not speculate on his return.",Basketball,67,,4,

That's 60 points, 21 rebounds, 10 assists, all racked up against the New York Knicks in Tuesday's night's 126-121 overtime victory. In doing so, the 23-year-old becomes the youngest player to achieve such an accolade - a record previously held by none other than Wilt Chamberlain (26). Chamberlain would have been smiling down on Doncic's magic, as he wove his way through and around the Knicks defence, even at one point, hitting a jump shot with one second remaining, after intentionally missing a free throw to send the game into overtime. He certainly had the fans, media attendance, and players on both sides spellbound, with the NBA twitter sphere just as mesmerised.",Basketball,136,,5,

Jamal Murray scored 26 points and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 15 for the Nuggets, who have won four straight. Ayton opened overtime with a 14-footer but Denver responded with the next eight points to go ahead 121-115 with 2:30 left.

93,"Back with a bang atop the East Conference standings, it was once again the mesmerising duo of Jayson Tatum and Jalen Brown who demoted the Bucks, with a 121-109 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. It was a much-needed win after the Celtics racked up consecutive defeats to the Orlando Magic and appeared in turmoil ahead of the Christmas run-in with four losses in five games. Fortunately, Tatum and Brown, who scored 23 of his 36 points on Friday in the fourth quarter, was able to help turn things around. His team will need more of the same when they face off the Bucks in a tantalising Christmas Day match-up.",Basketball,113,,5,

When it comes to which players will make the starting five for the game on February 19 in Salt Lake City, there are plenty of intriguing individuals to sift through. The Indiana Pacers star is on par to complete the season averaging at least 19 points and 10 assists, while shooting over 38 per cent from deep - a feat that only Michael Jordan and Chris Paul have achieved. Haliburton's silky ballhandling and fast transition moves have made him a painfully difficult opposition for defenders across the league (just ask the Miami Heat). Whether it's exploding with a franchise-record 10 three-pointers in a game, or shooting from within the paint, the accuracy and efficiency at which he does so, makes him a prime backcourt contender.",Basketball,150,,5,

Leaders last week, MVP frontrunner Giannis Antetokounmpo and co have now returned as the number two seed after their 118-100 defeat to the Brooklyn Nets on Friday.

The man is a beast on both ends of the court, averaging 31.2 points per game, as well as 11.2 rebounds in defensive transitions. Aside from the obvious physique qualities, Giannis has played a huge role in the Milwaukee Bucks' positioning atop the Eastern Conference with his ballhandling skills. With him leading the charge, the Bucks have gone toe to toe with the dominant Boston Celtics, which is exactly the reason why he commands the perfect frontcourt starter position.",Basketball,109,,4,

Amidst the highs and lows, however, there has been one constant: a fit and healthy Donovan Mitchell, doing Donovan Mitchell things. Averaging 28.9 points a game, and consistently performing alongside Darius Garland, Mitchell is shooting at 50.3 per cent, and will likely only improve as the play-in's approach.
